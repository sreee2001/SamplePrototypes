This folder contains a minimal .NET Razor Pages skeleton to show the hotel booking UI.

To run (requires .NET 8+ SDK):

1. Open a terminal in this folder.
2. Run: dotnet new webapp -n HotelBookingAppRazor
3. Replace Pages/Index.cshtml and Pages/\_Layout.cshtml with the provided UI files.
4. dotnet run

Notes: I included starter files and a data JSON in ../data that you can load via static file or embedded resource.
